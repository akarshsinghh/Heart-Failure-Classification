# Heart-Failure-Classification
This Notebook is based off an open source dataset available on www.kaggle.com where I have created models to classify patients who can potentially witness heart failure on the basis of various parameters. The best model had an accuracy of 94% and a recall of 91%
All models are subject to betterment with more stringent hyper-parameter tuning. This can be achieved by random selection, brute force methods, etc. Various other classifiers can also be used, but the most standard classifiers have been considered in this notebook.
Recommend standard practices for data transformation, outlier detection, and null value substitution have been incorporated in this notebook
This code has been UPVOTED by 15 People, Including Kaggle Grandmasters (Highly recognised people for their achievements in the data science Community). I have received a bronze medal for my code in the community and
